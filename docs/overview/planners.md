# Planners

Planners, often used instead of local planners, are the planning algorithms that control the navigation of the mobile robot. Local planning deals with obstacle-avoidance while following the precalculated global path. Each planner is maintained in its own repository.

We offer the following DRL planners:

- Rosnav: Our own planner based on neural networks.
- Dragon: TODO
- Trail: TODO
- Applr: TODO
- RLCA-ROS: TODO
- CADRL: TODO
- SARL-Star: TODO
- Crowdnav-ROS

As well as the following non-DRL planners:

- TEB
- DWA
- MPC
