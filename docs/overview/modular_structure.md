# Modular Structure

Arena-Rosnav is a modular ecosystem which is composed of planners, simulation environments and general utils.
Planners and general utils are designed to work in all simulation environments. During launch the user specifies the planner and simulation parameters which will trigger interactions between the modules to establish the simulation.
