# Simulation Environments

The simulation environments are the core of Arena-Rosnav. They establish the robot simulations for training and testing the mobile robot navigation approaches. This includes the generation of the map/world, the physics engine and sensor and scan data.

We offer the following environments:

- **arena-rosnav**: 2D simulation environment for benchmarking and training.
- **arena-rosnav-3d**: 3D environment especially designed for benchmarking.
