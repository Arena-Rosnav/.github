# Simulation Environments

The simulation environments are the core of Arena-Rosnav. They establish the robot simulations for training and testing the mobile robot navigation approaches.

We offer the following environments:

- arena-rosnav: 2D simulation environment for benchmarking and training.
- arena-rosnav-3d: 3D environment especially designed for benchmarking.
