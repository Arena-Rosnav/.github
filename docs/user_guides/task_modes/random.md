### Random

The random task spawns a random static and dynamic obstacles on every reset and will create a new robot start and goal position for each task. The models for the spawned obstacles are randomly choosen. To change the different models that can be spawned or the amount of spawned static or dynamic obstacles change the parameter `task_mode/random` in `src/arena-rosnav/arena_bringup/configs/task_generator.yaml`.
