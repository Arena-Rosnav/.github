### RViz UI
The RViz UI task mode is a persistent component that is consistently loaded, providing real-time interaction and control capabilities. It actively listens to override topics and overrides the tools in the RViz UI.

The following tools are changed:

- 2D Pose Estimate: Teleports the robot to the clicked position on the map.

- 2D Nav Goal: Set a new goal for the robot's navigation. 

- Public Point: Manual reset.
