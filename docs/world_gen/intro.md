# Introduction

This plugin has the goal to generate a meaningful map, world or floor plan and returning it in a general data structure.  
This can then later be used in different simulators to generate the enviroment. In the beggining ther will only be 2D maps returned.

The returned map will be in (JSON/Array/Image) form.
